				They way that I found anime was through AMV of music that I liked and they were intresting.
				Then I found one AMV the song was called King By Lauren Aquilina, the AMV anime was called Hotarubi no Mori e aka Forest of Fireflies.
				At first I got annoyed beacuse I couldnt find the aniem in English but when I finaly found the English version it did not sound good at all so I decided to what it in Japanese.
				The Japanese version made it sound so peacful and I loved it. The Anime was a very sad Anime and but it was amazing.
				I could not stop thinking about how I felt when I watched it and I got addicted to the Japanese language.
				I was so exited so I decided to search more anime like Forest of Fireflies and I found so many and I got so happy.
				I decided to stay up and watch the anime but I could not find all of them Online so I got a app Called Crunchyroll but the app had so many Adds so I got the premuim version with no Adds
				and so I could watch anime without Adds playing every three seconds and that is how I got addicted to anime.
